=head1 NAME

Binary::WebSocketAPI::v3::Subscription::ExchangeRates - The class that handle exchange rates subcription channels

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $worker = Binary::WebSocketAPI::v3::Subscription::ExchangeRates->new(
        c          => $c,
        type       => $type,
        args       => $args,
        symbol     => $symbol,
    );

    $worker->subscribe($callback);  # do subscribe and execute a callback after subscribed.
    $worker->unsubscribe;
    undef $worker; # Destroying the object will also call unsubscribe method

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module deals with the exchange rates channel subscriptions. We can subscribe one channel
as many times as we want. L<Binary::WebSocketAPI::v3::SubscriptionManager> will
subscribe that channel on redis server only once and this module will register
information that will be fetched when the message arrive. So to avoid duplicate
subscription, we can store the worker in the stash with the unique key.

Please refer to L<Binary::WebSocketAPI::v3::Subscription>
