# The purpose of this module is to Mojo::IOLoop::Server::_accept().
# It should be loaded early on by Binary::WebSocketAPI.

# The problem with the default Mojolicious implementation is that
# it does not allow for more or less equal load distribution among
# the prefork worker processes. This is usually not a problem for
# pure web servers but if the server mainly handles websocket
# connections, having most of them connected to the same process
# is bad.

# In the original code, whenever the listening handle becomes available,
# a loop is started to accept all connection requests. With websockets
# connection requests are rare and connections are long-lived. Also,
# processes handling these connections should be mostly in an idle state
# where they are able to react on incoming traffic. This leads now to
# the following situation. Several processes are waiting to accept
# connections. When a request comes in all of them are woken up and
# race to accept it. Unfortunately Linux does not wake them up in random
# order but in LIFO. So, the last process that entered the wait queue
# is woken up first. Usually it succeeds to accept the connection.
# But this process takes a longer time than simply failing to accept.
# So, normally all the other processes will have queued up again when
# the process that accepted the connection enters the queue. That way
# that process becomes the first to be woken up for the next connection
# request. This proceeds until this process becomes slightly overloaded.

# The idea to solve this problem is to delay accepting the connection
# request a tiny random bit. This re-shuffles the queue. Since
# connection requests are rare, this additional delay should not matter
# at all.

# In addition to solving he main problem this module also pushes
# information about the current number of connections to datadog
# and provides a function to classify the current connection count.
# The result of this function is supposed to be used as a tag sent
# with other metrics to datadog.
