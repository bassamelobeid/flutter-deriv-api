=head1 fetch_surface

Like a factory for BOM::MarketData::VolSurface, will give you an instance of
the relevant sub-class for the underlying you give. The instances themselves
are automatically associated with a corresponding document in the DB, so
asking the instance for data has the effect of loading from DB.
