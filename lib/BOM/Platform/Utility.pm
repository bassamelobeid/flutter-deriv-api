BOM::Platform::Utility

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A collection of helper methods.

=cut

=head2 hash_to_array

Extract values from a hashref and returns as an arrayref.

It takes a hashref:

=over 4

=item * C<hash> an input hashref 

Example:
    $input: {
        a => ['1', '2', '3'],
        b => {
            c => ['4', '5', '6'],
            d => ['7', '8', '9'],
        }
    }
    # see test

=back

Returns an arrayref.

Example:
    $output: ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'];

=cut

sub hash_to_array {
    my ($hash) = @_;
    return _hash_to_array_helper([], [clone($hash)]);
}

=head2 _hash_to_array_helper

Recursively calls itself and extract values from a hashref $stack.

It takes:

=over 4

=item * C<array> an arrayref that holds the output values 

=item * C<stack> an arrayref of a copy of input hash

=back

Returns an arrayref that holds the values of a hash.

=cut

sub _hash_to_array_helper {
    my ($array, $stack) = @_;

    return $array unless $stack->@*;

    my $temp_stack = [];
    foreach my $value ($stack->@*) {
        next unless defined $value;

        my $refs = $value;
        $refs = [$value] unless ref $value eq 'ARRAY';

        for ($refs->@*) {
            push $temp_stack->@*, values $_->%* if ref $_ eq 'HASH';
            push $temp_stack->@*, $_->@*        if ref $_ eq 'ARRAY';
            push $array->@*,      $_ unless ref $_;
        }
    }
    return _hash_to_array_helper($array, $temp_stack);
}

=head2 extract_valid_params

Extract valid params by testing againest regex

=over 4

=item * C<params> fields to be filtered

=item * C<args> values of C<params>

=item * C<regex_validation_keys> hash contains key and value regex as key/value pair.

=back

Returns valid params

=cut

sub extract_valid_params {
    my ($params, $args, $regex_validation_keys) = @_;

    my %filtered_params;
    my @remaining_params = $params->@*;

    foreach my $key_regex (keys $regex_validation_keys->%*) {
        my $value_regex = $regex_validation_keys->{$key_regex};

        %filtered_params = (
            %filtered_params, map { $_ => $args->{$_} }
                grep { defined $args->{$_} && $_ =~ $key_regex && $args->{$_} =~ $value_regex } @remaining_params
        );
        @remaining_params = grep { $_ !~ $key_regex } @remaining_params;
    }

    %filtered_params = (%filtered_params, map { $_ => $args->{$_} } @remaining_params);
    return \%filtered_params;
}

=head2 error_map

Returns a mapping from error codes to error messages as a hash-ref.

=head2 create_error

Creates the standard error structure.

Takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<$error_code> - A key from C<error_map> hash as string

=item * C<%options> - List of possible options to be used in creating the error, containing the following keys:

=over 4

=item * C<message_params> - List of values for placeholders to pass to C<localize()>, should be arrayref if more than one value

=item * C<details> - Hashref containing the details about this error in case C<details> provided in <options> parameter

=back

=back

Returns error as hashref containing the following keys:

=over 4

=item * C<code> - The error code from C<error_map>

=item * C<message> - The localized error message

=item * C<details> - Hashref containing the exact C<details> passed in <options> parameter

=head2 status_op_processor

Given an input and a client, this sub will process the given statuses expecting multiple
statuses passed.

It takes the following arguments:

=over 4

=item * C<client> - the client instance

=item * C<input> - a hashref of the user inputs

=back

The input should have a B<status_op> key that may contain:

=over 4

=item * C<remove> - this op performs a status removal from the client

=item * C<remove_siblings> - the same as `remove` but will also remove the status from siblings

=item * C<sync> - this op copies the given statuses to the siblings

=back

From the input hashref we will look for a `status_checked` value that can either be an arrayref or string (must check for that).
This value represents the given status codes.

Returns a summary to print out or undef if nothing happened.
