=head1 SYNOPSIS

my $doughflow_client = BOM::Platform::Client::DoughFlowClient->new({'loginid' => 'CR5066'});

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Dough Flow integration has some specific requirements for its Client fields.

Specifically for the GetCustomer API.

This class coerces our existing Client data into a form that DoughFlow will accept.

It is now a Rose::DB::Object derived class so all Client table columns are available as get/sets.
