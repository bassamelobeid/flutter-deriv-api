BOM::Platform::CryptoCashier::AutoUpdatePayouts::Reject;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script aims to automatically reject cryptocurrency withdrawal requests for the following rules defined by payments:

1. Reject cryptocurrency withdrawal requests if the highest net deposit method is not `crypto` within the limit of six months (limit is configurable via BO).
