=item get_default_plan

Given a MyAffiliates affiliate id, gives the default plan that the affiliate
is paid under.

If the affiliate is registered with more than one plan, it will default
to Revenue Share if present, and will never return Creative.

Given an Affiliate instance, will query MyAffiliates and return
the affiliate's myaffiliates id.

If it can't get the affiliate id for any reason at all, it
returns false. If/when we get an actual API for searching over
affiliate info, we'll be able to make this more informative.

associated with it and return their MyAffiliates affiliate id.

    # promo code FREECASH and another FREECASHNOW, a search for FREECASH would
    # match both, which is not what we want.
    # Also, to do partial searches we need to use the % wildcard, which on URLs
    # needs to be encoded as %25.
    return $self->_find_affiliate_by_variable('betonmarkets_promo_code' => "%;$promocode;%");
}

=item _find_affiliate_by_variable

 Call their Search API to find a user with a particular variable set.
 Use %25 as wildcard on the $value parameter

 Returns an affiliate id if exactly one id is found, false otherwise.

 eg.:
    exact match:
    _find_affiliate_by_variable('betonmarkets_client_loginid' => $bom_loginid);
    wildcard match for ;promocode;:
    _find_affiliate_by_variable('betonmarkets_promo_code' => "%25;$promocode;%25");

=item fetch_BOM_account_transactions

Returns an array of "to BOM account" payment transactions
(HashRefs, with details of a transaction from the MyAffiliates system).

# MyAffiliates have four transaction types that you'll find against an
# affiliate's account:
#
# 1. Commission earned
#      Actual commission earned. Such a transaction will be credited to an affiliate
#      every month, no matter how small (and as long as their referrals' activity
#      results in them being owed commission of course).
#      These transactions are always CREDITED to the account it seems.
# 2. Payment out
#      When the affiliate accrues enough commission and breaks over minimum payment
#      threshold, a "payment to affiliate" transaction is added to the account.
#      This DEBITS from the account, and we are expected to then actually pay the
#      affiliate this amount.
#      So note: MyAffiliates do not wait for conformation that we paid the affiliate
#      or anything like that; they debit the payment first, and expect us to find
#      out what they should be paid, and pay them sucessfully.
# 3. Offset
#      Counteracts negative commission earned if business rules allow
#      (we don't do this).
# 4. Manual adjustment
#      If there's ever a need to manually adjust an account, the resulting
#      transaction will have this type.
