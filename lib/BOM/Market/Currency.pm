=head1 METHODS

=head2 new($symbol)

Constructor. Should be used in the following ways:

Saving new interest rates:
  ->new(symbol => 'SYM', rates => {...}, date => Date::Utility->new);
  ->save;

Fetching the latest rates in DB:
  ->new('SYM');
  ->new(symbol => 'SYM');

Fetching historical rates:
  ->new(symbol => 'SYM', for_date => Date::Utility->new('some time in the past'));
