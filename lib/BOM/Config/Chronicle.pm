=head1 NAME

BOM::Config::Chronicle - Provides efficient data storage for volatile and time-based data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains helper methods which can be used to store and retrieve information
on an efficient storage with below properties:

=over 4

=item B<Timeliness>

It is assumed that data to be stored are time-based meaning they change over time and the latest version is most important for us.
Many data structures in our system fall into this category (For example Volatility Surfaces, Interest Rate information, ...).

=item B<Efficient>

The module uses Redis cache to provide efficient data storage and retrieval.

=item B<Persistent>

In addition to caching every incoming data, it is also stored in PostgresSQL for future retrieval.

=item B<Distributed>

These data are stored in distributed storage so they will be replicated to other servers instantly.

=item B<Transparent>

This modules hides all the details about distribution, caching, database structure and ... from developer. He only needs to call a method
to save data and another method to retrieve it. All the underlying complexities are handled by the module.

=back

There are two important methods this module provides:

=over 4

=item C<get_chronicle_reader>

Returns a Data::Chronicle::Reader object.

=item C<get_chronicle_writer>

Returns a Data::Chronicle::Writer object.

=head1 Example

    use BOM::Config::Chronicle;

    my $d = get_some_data();
    my $reader = BOM::Config::Chronicle::get_chronicle_reader();
    my $writer = BOM::Config::Chronicle::get_chronicle_writer();

    #store data into Chronicle
    writer->set("vol_surface", "frxUSDJPY", $d);

    #retrieve latest data stored for "vol_surface" and "frxUSDJPY"
    my $dt = $reader->get("vol_surface", "frxUSDJPY");

    #find vol_surface for frxUSDJPY as of a specific date
    my $some_old_data = $reader->get_for("vol_surface", "frxUSDJPY", $epoch1);
