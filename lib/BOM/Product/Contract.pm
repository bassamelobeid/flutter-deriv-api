=head1 NAME

BOM::Product::Contract - represents a contract object for a single bet

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use feature qw(say);
    use BOM::Product::ContractFactory qw(produce_contract);
    # Create a simple contract
    my $contract = produce_contract({
        bet_type => 'CALLE',
        duration => '5t',
    });
    # Show the current prices (as of now, since an explicit pricing date is not provided)
    say "Bid for CALLE:  " . $contract->bid_price;
    say "Ask for CALLE:  " . $contract->ask_price;
    # Get the contract with the opposite bet type, in this case a PUT
    my $opposite = $contract->opposite_contract;
    say "Bid for PUT:    " . $opposite->bid_price;
    say "Ask for PUT:    " . $opposite->ask_price;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is the base definition for all our contract types. It provides behaviour common to all contracts,
and defines the standard API for interacting with those contracts.

Was this bet built using BOM-generated parameters, as opposed to user-supplied parameters?

Be sure, as this allows us to relax some checks. Don't relax too much, as this still came from a

This will contain the shortcode of the original bet, if we built it from one.

=head1 METHODS - Boolean checks

=cut

=head2 is_after_expiry

This check if the contract already passes the expiry times

For tick expiry contract, there is no expiry time, so it will check again the exit tick
For other contracts, it will check the remaining time of the contract to expiry.

=cut

sub is_after_expiry {
    my $self = shift;

    if ($self->tick_expiry) {
        # We've expired if we have an exit tick...
        return 1 if $self->exit_tick;
        # ... or if we're past our predefined max contract duration for tick trades
        return 1 if $self->date_pricing->epoch - $self->date_start->epoch > $self->_max_tick_expiry_duration->seconds;
        # otherwise, we're still active
        return 0;
    }

    # Delegate to the same method in L<Finance::Contract>
    return $self->next::method;
}

=head2 is_after_settlement

This check if the contract already passes the settlement time

For tick expiry contract, it can expires when a certain number of ticks is received or it already passes the max_tick_expiry_duration.
For other contracts, it can expires when current time has past a pre-determined settelement time.

=cut

sub is_after_settlement {
    my $self = shift;

    if ($self->tick_expiry) {
        return 1

    } else {
        return 1 if $self->get_time_to_settlement->seconds == 0;
    }

    return 0;
}

=head2 is_expired

Returns true if this contract is expired.

It is expired only if it passes the expiry time time and has valid exit tick.

=cut

sub is_expired { die "Calling ->is_expired on a ::Contract instance" }

=head2 is_legacy

True for obsolete contract types, see L<BOM::Product::Contract::Invalid>.

=cut

sub is_legacy { return 0 }

=head2 is_settleable

Returns true if the contract is settleable.

To be able to settle, it need pass the settlement time and has valid exit tick

=cut

sub is_settleable { die "Calling ->is_settleable on a ::Contract instance" }

sub may_settle_automatically {
    my $self = shift;

    # For now, only trigger this condition when the bet is past expiry.
