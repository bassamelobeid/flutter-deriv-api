# Pricing and Market Data Service

## Mission

Our mission is to provide a service that calculates prices for the contracts on offer in a timely fashion.

We provide pricing and market data services. The market data service is used
internally to calculate prices. The pricing service is exposed externally and
provides price updates based on current market conditions to our clients as
well as to internal services and the quant team. Providing fast and precise
prices, detecting and reacting on quickly changing market conditions means that
we can provide the best prices for our client while at the same time ensuring
that we are not losing money on the trades.


### Vision

Our vision is to have a service that is capable of producing price updates for
all contracts in real-time, scaling automatically depending on
the current load, and supporting new types of contracts
with relative ease. We also aim to make all prices easily reproducible.
