# Activity

## Active projects

### Offerings service

We are working on implementing the offerings service. The service that would
allow query and validate offerings. This service is a prerequisite for us to
start working on the separating pricing service and providing pricing as an
API. It is a part of phase one of the pricing service roadmap.

Progress:

- implemented parsing of config files with offerings information
- implemented offering validation
- defined the API
- build scripts

### Chronicle client library

We are working on implementing a library that would allow us to access
information in the chronicle database. This information is needed to configure
pricers.

## Accomplished

- We documented the architecture of the future pricing service.
