## Active projects

### Offerings service

We are working on implementing the offerings service. The service that would
allow query and validate offerings. This service is a prerequisite for us to
start working on the separating pricing service and providing pricing as an
API. It is a part of phase one of the pricing service roadmap.

## Accomplished

We documented the architecture of the future pricing service.
