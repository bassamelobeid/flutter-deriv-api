# Welcome to the P2P Service

## What is P2P?

P2P = Peer to Peer

P2P allows Deriv users to buy and sell Deriv credits from or to other users.

- A user will place an advertisment to sell or buy their Deriv credits.
- Another user will place an order on the advert.
- The users will arrange payment between themselves using a third party payment system.
- Once both users have confirmed the payment has been made, funds are transfered between the 2 Deriv accounts.

Example:<br>
John has $100 in his USD CR account. He creates an advert to sell $100.<br>
John lives in Brazil so the currency of the advert is BRL.<br>
John sets the exchange rate to 5.00, based on current market rate.<br>
John sets some acceptable payment methods, for example Bank Transfer and Skrill.<br>
Mary places an order against the advert to buy $50.<br>
Mary sends 250 BRL to John via Skrill (USD 50 at the exchange rate of 5.00).<br>
Mary clicks "I've paid" in P2P.<br>
John clicks "I've received payment" in P2P.<br>
P2P transfers 50.00 from John's CR account to Mary's CR account.<br>
