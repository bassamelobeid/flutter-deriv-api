=head1 NAME

start_long_running_job_queue.pl - Long running job queue runner

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is designed as a generic queue runner for various long running queues.
This can run multiple synchronous jobs that take minutes to hours to complete.
Rather than having multiple PL files for each queue this takes a Queue name parameter among others so
it can be reused.

Because the Event system will not rerun failed or incomplete jobs, Long running jobs need to make sure they are
capable of being rerun.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    start_long_running_job_queue.pl  --streams <stream1,stream2> --queue <queue_name> --maximum_process_time=<Process time out> --maximum_job_time=<Max job time> --number_of_workers=<number of processes to spawn> --shutdown_time_out=<Number of seconds allowed for graceful shutdown>


=over 4

=item * --queue  the name of the queue in Redis that this will be listening to.

=item * --streams  comma separated list of Redis streams to listen to.

=item * --type  type of jobs to process

=item * --maximum_process_time : The maximum number of seconds a Synchronous job can run for.

=item * --maximum_job_time : The maximum number of seconds an Ansychronous Job can run for.

=item * --number_of_workers :  The Number of forks of this script to run in parallel.  Defaults to  the the number of cpu's available.

=item * --shutdown_time_out :  The amount of time to allow for a graceful shutdown after the C<TERM> or C<INT> signal is received. Once reached the C<KILL> signal will be sent.

=item * --json_log_file : The json format log file
