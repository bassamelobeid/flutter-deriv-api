=head2 report suspended settings

This module sends metrics to DataDog about suspended settings in the backoffice
to avoid forgetting about re-enabling them.

Each setting has a key called C<_local_rev> which is used to determine when the
key was set, we use that key to calculate the age of the key.

=head2 is_active

Check if a setting is active, expects data with the following format:

    {
        data => [value]
    }

where value is either a scalar or a ref.  A setting is active if the value of
C<data> is true. In case of ref it is dereferenced to check if the value is true.

sub is_active {
    # Not active if the key is not set
    return 0 unless my $settings = shift;

    # Not active if the data is false
    return 0 unless my $data = $settings->{data};

    if (ref $data) {
        # Not active if data has no item
        return 0 unless $data->@*;
    }

    return 1;
