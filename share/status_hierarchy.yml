# This YML consists of a structure where each value holds the children of the status represented in key

# It represents the hierarchical structure of user statuses resricted to two levels of hierarchy.
# The keys in the hash represent the status names, and the values are arrays of child statuses for each key.
# If a status is applied, its parent status will also be applied.

# Example:
# {
#     'A' => ['B', 'C'],
#     'D' => ['E', 'F'],
#     'G' => ['H'],
# }

# Example Diagram:
#        A          D       G
#      /   \      /   \     |
#     B     C    E     F    H

# This structure represents a hierarchical relationship between statuses.
# If any status is applied, parent status will also be applied
# For example, if status 'B' is applied, status 'A' will also be applie.
