# This yml file contains an array of hashrefs
# Each hashref contains a list of threshold values
# The threshold values below are given by the social responsibility team, based on the statistics collected from the last 3 years.
# The regulation requirement for this comes from: https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/PDF/Customer-interaction-%E2%80%93-guidance-for-remote-gambling-operators.pdf (Pages 2,4,6)

# When client breaches thresholds (based on the hits_required), they are considered at-risk 
# NOTE: Currently, this is applicable to MX-MLT (Last updated: 1st May, 2019)

# Example: If a client has losses of 700, made 17 deposits, and deposits totalled at 850,
# They have breached three threshold limits and fulfilled the number of hits required
# to be classified at risk
