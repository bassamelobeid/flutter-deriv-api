In fact all sales are \"at market\", hence if this value is supplied, and the market price for sell-back of the given contract has gone up, the sale will be made at the higher price. It will be rejected with an error message if the market price has moved down. So this field allows the buyer to nominate a minimum expected price for the sale."
